# Paleocurrent_Dispersion

## Directions

The Dispersion Calculator is designed to input a .csv file of raw directional measurements and calculate the dispersion value for those measurements. This script is only meant for raw paleocurrent directions (or any other directional measurements one would like to know). To first check for modality, a rose diagram plotting tool should be used. 

The other scripts are the ones that I used for my master thesis to calculate dispersion of modern river systems. Those along with the included Thesis_Data.xlsx file are included for repeatablility and transparency for my research. 

### Abstract

Large-scale depositional river systems typically develop into either a lower-sinuous abraided or higher-sinuous meandering morphology linked, in part, to the boundary conditions experienced by the basin. However, inferring these planform morphologies from ancient fluvial systems in the rock record is tenuous. In alluvial stratigraphy, vertical sandbody exposures in many cases yield lithofacies characteristics and patterns that are nonunique for even endmember planform fluvial systems. Yet, within fluvial sandbodies, sedimentary structures preserve a range of paleo-flow directions (i.e., paleocurrents) ultimately tied to the sinuosity of the ancient channels. The range and density of these directional measurements can be quantified by calculating a dispersion value for the dataset. In this study I calculated dispersion values linked to the known planform morphologies of 112 modern rivers. For each channel, the centerline azimuth directions (n = 250) were consecutively measured over a well-defined section of the river. To replicate natural variation in bedform directions from channel centerline azimuth, a “transport anomaly” value, calculated by measuring the difference between bedform migration direction and channel centerline azimuths in modern rivers, was randomly assigned to each channel azimuth measurement. Results show dispersion values for braided systems ranged from 0.600 to 0.775 and values meandering systems ranged from 0.275 to 0.581, showing a clear separation between end-member morphologies. This suggests planform morphology feasibly can be recovered from sufficiently large (n > 55) paleocurrent measurements from a fluvial sandbody. Moreover, the dataset shows dispersion correlates (R2 = 0.92) with the intensity of sinuosity of meandering rivers. This offers the additional opportunity to quantitatively estimate paleo-sinuosity from outcrops. I evaluated the applicability of this approach using two case studies in Cretaceous and Paleogene strata of Utah and Wyoming, respectively, wherein fluvial sandbody channels crop out as inverted topographic features on the modern landscape. In both braided and meandering cases the dispersion and sinuosity reconstructions were successful identifying known planform morphology and sinuosity. ![image](https://github.com/TonySombrero/Paleocurrent_Dispersion/assets/77590615/5bfc815b-f132-4bb8-a765-d6de6f3ef751)
